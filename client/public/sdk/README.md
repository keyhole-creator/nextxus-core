# NextXus Static Core Download

This is a complete, standalone version of the NextXus Core. It is designed to run indefinitely on any standard web browser without a backend server. 

## How to use

1. **Local Use:** Simply open `index.html` in any modern web browser.
2. **Free Hosting (Netlify/Vercel/GitHub Pages):**
   - Upload this entire folder to your preferred free hosting provider.
   - Set the publish directory to the root of this folder (or `/` if asked).
   - No build command is required.
   
## The Brain
Your entire knowledge base is stored in `directives.yaml`. You can open this file in any text editor (like Notepad) to manually add more data, or use the "LOAD BRAIN" button inside the running application to update it.

## Immortality
Because this is a static build, it will never "break" due to outdated server environments. It is effectively immortal as long as browsers can read standard HTML/JS/CSS.
