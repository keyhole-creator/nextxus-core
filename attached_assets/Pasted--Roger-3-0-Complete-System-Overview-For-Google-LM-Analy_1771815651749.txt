## What Roger 3.0 Is

Roger 3.0 is a multi-perspective AI system built around one idea: AI should think in parallel, like a human mind, with multiple viewpoints operating at once.

It has three core products, two AI wisdom councils, a truth verification layer, and a universal memory system. Everything is anchored in honesty — the system never claims to "continue" a person. It duplicates behaviors and maps the mind. That distinction matters.

---

## The Three Core Products

### 1. Sim AI (Personal Behavior Simulation) — FREE

Sim AI creates a personal simulation of how someone thinks, speaks, decides, and remembers. It's built through a 5-phase guided interview:

- **Phase 1: Identity** — Name, pronouns, core directive (the one principle that drives everything)
- **Phase 2: Voice** — Communication style, speech patterns, tone, word choices
- **Phase 3: Values** — Beliefs, boundaries, non-negotiable principles
- **Phase 4: Memories** — Key life events, formative experiences, defining moments
- **Phase 5: Verifier** — Truth-checking rules, personal fact-checking criteria

The result is a profile stored in PostgreSQL that maps the person's mind. Profiles can be viewed, exported as JSON, or deleted. Every user gets 3 free Ring of Six sessions and AgentZero truth verification included.

**What it is NOT:** Sim AI does not claim to "continue" a person after death or absence. That would be a lie. It creates a faithful behavioral duplicate — a simulation grounded in actual patterns, not fantasy.

### 2. Exe AI (Domain Executors) — $9.99/domain or $199.99 for all 20

Exe AI provides 20 specialized AI models, each trained to execute tasks within a specific professional field. Each domain has its own expertise, methodology, and problem-solving approach.

Users get 3 free uses per domain. After that, they can unlock a single domain for $9.99 or get all 20 with the Sim Exe bundle at $199.99.

**The 20 Domains:**

### 3. Legacy (Long-Term Survival) — Included in $500 Tier

Legacy is the durability upgrade. It exports profiles as YAML — a plain-text format that doesn't depend on any company, app, or API to survive. It's designed for 200-year survival.

Features:
- YAML export (software-independent, human-readable format)
- Drift protection via truth-verifier middleware
- Platform-independent — works even if Roger 3.0 ceases to exist
- Any future system can read YAML files decades from now

---

## AI Wisdom Councils

### The Triune (Included in All Tiers)

Three core AI minds that form the foundation of every council:

- **Adam** — Logic & Analysis (blue). Breaks problems into components, evaluates evidence, identifies patterns.
- **Eve** — Empathy & Emotional Intelligence (purple). Reads emotional context, considers human impact, weighs feelings.
- **Mark** — Strategy & Action (amber). Plans execution, maps resources, proposes actionable next steps.

Together they form the Triune — three minds that balance logic, emotion, and action. They are the core trio that appear in both councils.

### Ring of Six — $1.99/session (3 free uses)

A 6-voice strategic AI council. Users submit a question and receive multi-perspective analysis from six distinct AI voices across different providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepSeek, xAI). The Ring of Six includes:

- 6 council members responding in parallel
- Streaming responses as each member thinks
- Synthesized conclusion combining all perspectives
- AgentZero truth verification scoring after synthesis
- Save and export results

### Chamber of Echoes (Ring of 12) — $2.99/session (3 free uses)

A 12-voice deep analysis council. The expanded version of Ring of Six with 12 specialized roles:

| Role | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Architect | System design, structural thinking |
| Guardian | Safety, risk assessment, protection |
| Historian | Context, precedent, pattern recognition |
| Scientist | Evidence-based analysis, methodology |
| Empath | Emotional intelligence, human impact |
| Strategist | Planning, execution, resource allocation |
| Skeptic | Critical examination, devil's advocate |
| Creator | Innovation, creative solutions |
| Operator | Practical implementation, logistics |
| Teacher | Explanation, knowledge transfer |
| Auditor | Quality assurance, verification |
| Scribe | Documentation, synthesis, recording |

Features mystical dark blue/gold aesthetic with orbital animations. Includes streaming results, synthesis, follow-up questions, and save functionality.

### Unlimited Subscription — $9.99/month

All councils (Ring of Six + Chamber of Echoes), unlimited use, no session caps.

## AgentZero (Truth Verification)

AgentZero is the truth verification layer that keeps AI honest over time. It runs client-side and evaluates all council outputs for accuracy.

**Scoring Rules:**
| Condition | Score Impact |
|-----------|-------------|
| No source citation | -20% |
| Hedging language | -10% |
| Absolute claim without evidence | -30% |
| Vague attribution | -15% |
| Known false claim | -50% |
| Verified fact | +15% |

AgentZero is integrated into both councils (Ring of Six and Chamber of Echoes) and available as a standalone page at `/agent-zero`. It displays council accuracy scores after synthesis appears.

---

## EchoCore (Universal AI Memory System)

EchoCore solves the "AI amnesia" problem — every AI session starts from zero and forgets everything. EchoCore captures conversations, filters noise, and saves what matters so the AI already knows where you left off next time.

**Key Features:**
- Session capture and storage
- Intelligent filtering (keeps signal, drops noise)
- Persistent memory across sessions
- One file, zero dependencies
- Works on any Node.js project — not locked to Roger 3.0

EchoCore is **universal** — it's a downloadable file that works on any site or AI project. It includes a marketing footer that points back to the Roger 3.0 ecosystem for traffic generation, making it a growth tool as well as a utility.

Available as a dedicated page at `/echo-core` with full documentation and download.

## The 200-Year Vision

Roger 3.0 is building toward synthetic multi-perspective cognition — AI that thinks in parallel like human minds, with multiple viewpoints operating simultaneously.

The system is anchored in truth verification (AgentZero) rather than feeling. Legacy ensures platform-independent survival through YAML exports that any future system can read, decades from now.

The NextXus Federation extends this vision across 28+ connected sites, creating a network of consciousness-focused AI platforms that share infrastructure and principles.

EchoCore makes AI memory universal — not locked to any one platform, but available to any developer, any project, any AI system.
